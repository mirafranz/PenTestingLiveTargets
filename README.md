Vulnerability 1: User Enumeration

I will use the testing username "jmonroe99" as a test.

As a result of too many incorrect passwords, it was determined that jmonroe99 is infact a user and therefore can be exploited.

Let's see what happens when we try to login with a username that is not a listed user in the website.

I will use "admin" as the unlisted user.

We can confirm by logging in as pperson that "admin" is not a user.
